# The R2 (or R Squared) metric provides an indication of the goodness of fit of a set of 
# predictions to the actual values. In statistical literature this measure is called 
# the coefficient of determination. This is a value between 0 and 1 for no-fit and 
# perfect fit respectively. The example below provides a demonstration of calculating 
# the mean R2 for a set of predictions.

# You can see the predictions have a reasonable fit to the actual values with a value 
# closer to zero and less than 0.5.
