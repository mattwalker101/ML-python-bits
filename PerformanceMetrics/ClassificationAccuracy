# Classification accuracy is the number of correct predictions made as a ratio of all 
# predictions made. This is the most common evaluation metric for classification problems, 
# it is also the most misused. It is really only suitable when there are an equal number of 
# observations in each class (which is rarely the case) and that all predictions and 
# prediction errors are equally important, which is often not the case. Below is an 
# example of calculating classification accuracy.
