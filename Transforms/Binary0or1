# You can transform your data using a binary threshold. All values above the threshold 
# are marked 1 and all equal to or below are marked as 0. This is called binarizing your 
# data or thresholding your data. It can be useful when you have probabilities that you 
# want to make crisp values. It is also useful when feature engineering and you want to 
# add new features that indicate something meaningful. You can create new binary attributes 
# in Python using scikit-learn with the Binarizer class.
